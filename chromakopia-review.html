            <h2>Album Review</h2>
            <p>As you can see from my ratings, I thought Chromakopia was a great album. Starting off with "St. Chroma," Tyler sets the bar high, creating anticipation and setting the tone for what’s to come. The energy continues with "Rah Tah Tah," "Noid," and "Darling, I," which together establish a great foundation for the album’s first act. These tracks are greatly produced, full of engaging melodies and dynamic vocal performances.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, after this great opening act, the album hits a bit of a lull with the track "I Killed You." While this songs isn't bad, it just lacks the same intensity, inventiveness, and storytelling of the initial tracks, which I believe makes the track feel underwhelming in comparison to the previous five songs. I found myself missing the angelic vocals and the amazing, melodic instrumental layers that made the earlier songs just that good. Thankfully, the momentum picks back up with "Judge Judy," another standout track that delivers not only a strong but a great song right into the album when it’s needed. However, it’s followed by "Sticky," a track that, in my view, falls very flat. "Sticky" lacks depth, with little to no substantive message or engaging themes to make it worth listening.</p>
            <p>"Take Your Mask Off," on the other hand, brings us right back into the greatness shown earlier, showcasing Daniel Caesar’s vocals and preparing us for the album’s latter half. "Tomorrow" is another highlight, reflecting Tyler’s growth as an artist with very thoughtful lyricism. "Thought I Was Dead" reintroduces the high-energy vibe of earlier tracks like "Rah Tah Tah," making it another great addition to the album’s progression. After this, we get to be blessed with the song "Like Him" which really shows us more of Tyler's story with his dad, being a deeply introspective and powerful track that easily earns its 10/10 rating. Tyler's emotional verses being complemented by Lola Young towards the end just gave it that oomf it didn't even need. Such soulful melodies and meaningful lyrics really help deliver this song on Tyler's exploration of family and the struggle of self-identity.</p>
            <p>The album closes with "Balloon" and "I Hope You Find Your Way Home," two tracks that, unfortunately, don’t quite deliver the impactful conclusion the album deserves. While both are alright, they lack the emotional weight needed to provide a satisfying resolution to the journey Chromakopia sets up.</p>
